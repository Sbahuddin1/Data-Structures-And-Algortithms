## Problem Description:

You are managing ads for a company, and each ad has a profitability value associated with it. The goal is to maximize the revenue generated by placing the ads on different platforms. Each ad has a corresponding profitability value, and you have two arrays (`a` and `b`) representing the profitability values of the ads on different platforms.

The program takes the size of the arrays `n` as input, where `n` is the number of ads. It then takes the profitability values for the first array `a` and the second array `b`. The task is to find the maximum dot product of the two arrays after sorting them in ascending order.

### Approach:

1. Sort both arrays `a` and `b` in ascending order.
2. Calculate the dot product of the sorted arrays, which is the sum of the products of corresponding elements.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
4
10 15 5 2
1 3 6 9
```

**Output:**
```
87
```

**Explanation:**
After sorting `a` and `b`, the dot product is calculated as `(2 * 9) + (5 * 6) + (10 * 3) + (15 * 1) = 87`, which is the maximum possible revenue.

This problem is commonly encountered in scenarios where you want to maximize revenue or profit by choosing the most profitable options from two sets of items.
