## Money Change Again

**Problem Statement:**
Compute the minimum number of coins needed to change the given value into coins with denominations 1, 3, and 4.

**Input Format:**
An integer `money` representing the value to be changed.

**Output Format:**
The minimum number of coins with denominations 1, 3, and 4 required to change the given value.

**Constraints:**
1 ≤ money ≤ 103

### Explanation:
The natural greedy strategy for the change problem does not always yield the optimal solution. For instance, for denominations 1, 3, and 4, the greedy algorithm may not produce the minimum number of coins needed. For example, when trying to change 6 cents, the greedy algorithm will use three coins (4 + 1 + 1), while it can be done with just two coins (3 + 3).

### Your Task:
Your goal is to apply dynamic programming to solve the Money Change Problem for denominations 1, 3, and 4.

**Sample Input/Output:**

*Input:*
```
34
```

*Output:*
```
9
```

*Explanation:*
34 can be represented as 3 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4 + 4, requiring a minimum of 9 coins with denominations 1, 3, and 4.

**Note:**
You are tasked with implementing an algorithm to efficiently solve the Money Change Problem, considering the denominations 1, 3, and 4. The solution should provide the minimum number of coins required to make the change for any given value within the provided constraints.
