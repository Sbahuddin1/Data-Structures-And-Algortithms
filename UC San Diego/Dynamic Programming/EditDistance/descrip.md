## Problem Explanation:

The Edit Distance Problem is a classic problem in computer science, often used in various applications such as computational biology, natural language processing, and spell checking. Given two strings, the goal is to determine the minimum number of single-symbol insertions, deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into the other. Each operation (insertion, deletion, substitution) has a cost of 1.

This problem is often solved using dynamic programming, where a table is used to store the results of sub-problems to avoid redundant computations.

### Examples:

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate the Edit Distance Problem.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
short
ports
Output:
3
```
Explanation:
To transform the first string "short" into the second string "ports", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Delete 's'.
2. Substitute 'h' with 'p'.
3. Insert 's' at the end.
Thus, the minimum edit distance is 3.

**Example 2:**
```
Input:
editing
distance
Output:
5
```
Explanation:
To transform the first string "editing" into the second string "distance", we need to perform the following operations:
1. Delete 'e'.
2. Insert 's' after 'i'.
3. Substitute 'i' with 'a'.
4. Substitute 'g' with 'c'.
5. Insert 'e' at the end.
Thus, the minimum edit distance is 5.

**Example 3:**
```
Input:
ab
ab
Output:
0
```
### Explanation:
Both strings are identical, so no operations are needed to transform one string into the other. Thus, the minimum edit distance is 0.

These examples demonstrate how the Edit Distance Problem works and how it can be solved to find the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.
