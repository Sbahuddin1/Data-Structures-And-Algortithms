## Problem Description

You are given a target string and a list of words. Your task is to determine how many different ways you can construct the target string using concatenations of words from the list.


**Input:**
- `target`: A string representing the target string.
- `words`: A list of strings representing the words that can be concatenated to form the target string.

**Output:**
- Returns an integer representing the number of different ways the target string can be constructed using concatenations of words from the list.

**Constraints:**
- The length of the target string is at most 1000.
- The length of each word in the list is at most 100.
- All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

**Example:**

```python
print(can_make("abcdef", ["ab", "abc", "cd", "def", "abcd"]))  # Output: 1
print(can_make("skateboard", ["bo", "rd", "ate", "t", "ska", "sk", "boar"]))  # Output: 0
print(can_make("enterapotentpot", ["a", "p", "ent", "enter", "ot", "o", "t"]))  # Output: 4
```

In the given examples, the function calculates the number of ways to construct the target string using words from the list. The function should return the count of valid combinations.


This problem involves dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of ways to form the target string. The solution utilizes a 1D array to keep track of the number of ways to form substrings of the target string.
